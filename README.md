usergrid-mobile
===============

Example code for my talk about building mobile apps with Apache Usergrid, jQuery Mobile and Apache Cordova. You can view a screencast of the talk on YouTube: 
__[All Things Open 2014: Building Mobile Apps with Apache UserGrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjFG-QbxxLw).__

This example app is was initially created by the Apache Cordova command line times. 
There are four versions of the app: v1, v2, v3 and v4. Each one of these versions 
is a branch in this GitHub repo and each represents a stage in the development of the app.

* [v1](https://github.com/snoopdave/usergrid-mobile/tree/v1) - Version one is the initial version 
of the app. After I created the app with Apache Cordova I added the Usergrid SDK, jQuery, jQuery 
Mobile and the ability for users to sign-up and to login.

* [v2](https://github.com/snoopdave/usergrid-mobile/tree/v2)- In the second stage I added the 
ability for users to be able to "checkin" and to view the checkins that they have created.

* [v3](https://github.com/snoopdave/usergrid-mobile/tree/v3)- In the third stage I added the 
ability for users to be able to view and follow each other users and to view the checkins 
of those that they follow.

* [v4](https://github.com/snoopdave/usergrid-mobile/tree/v4) - In the fourth stage of the 
project I added the code necessary for Apache Cordova to work together with jQuery Mobile. 
This is the version of the app that can be launched in a phone emulator by Apache Cordova.
